# DocPedia

DocPedia is an AI-based document querying application that enables users to upload PDF documents and query any information contained within them. With DocPedia, you can easily extract and retrieve specific information from your documents using LlamaIndex natural language queries. This app is powered by GPT-3.5 Turbo and OpenAI Embedding models.

Additionally, users can ask any question about the document's content and receive detailed explanations, making it a powerful tool for understanding and interacting with your document data. It stores the PDF using AWS S3 Bucket and uses boto3 to interact with the data and it can learn from several PDFs by indexing it together.
